28-Year-Old Chef Found Dead at San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old chef who had recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.
But the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone who would want to hurt him, saying, "Things were finally going well for him."
The body found at the Westfield Mall Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and an investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, previously a line cook in Boston, had landed his dream job as line chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesperson for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.
"We are a small team that operates like a close knit family and he will be dearly missed," the spokesperson said.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said Frank initially stayed in hostels, but recently, "Things were finally going well for him."
"He found an apartment, he was dating a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he could not think of anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a kind spirit with a big heart.
His way of connecting with the family was always making us a dish, making us dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be in any kind of altercation.
He was the brother that went with the flow.
"With everything else that's going wrong with the world, he was that diamond in the rough that was shining bright every day," he said.

Jennifer Aniston: I'm always pigeonholed
Jennifer Aniston need not always be perfect or successful.
That is what the Hollywood star has made abundantly clear in an interview.
"I'm always pigeonholed, or labelled by someone who has little, if anything, to do with me and reality."
"Personally, I have no desire to be perfect and successful all the time."
"To be honest, I don't really give a damn about things like that."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh that she has been dubbed "Miss Perfect" in the current issue of "Cosmopolitan".
The actress prefers to spend her time at home in front of the television with her hair in a relaxed bun, eating Mexican food, the magazine reports.
The question of whether she wants children makes her livid: "We women do not need to be married or have children to feel fulfilled," the Hollywood star says.
In her new film, "Mother's Day - love isn't child's play", Aniston stars as a single mother with two sons.
The film is released in Germany on 25 August.
Golfer Langer is awarded the Sport Pyramid
His experience on horseback is negligible.
At the end of a golfing tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and a colleague went for a ride along the beach for a bit of fun.
It was a first for the 58-year-old.
CHIO: "Golden Sport Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horse decided it wanted to go home, and raced back to its feeding trough at full tilt.
After a kilometre at this speed I was scared.
"It wasn't a good experience," said Langer.
And with that, his riding career came to an end again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - with 101 tournament wins under his belt - was once again near horses.
He and his family toured the ALRV grounds, but he did not jump onto a horse for a photo.
It was Langer's first time in Aachen, and at CHIO.
He had been thoroughly convinced.
The German Sport Aid foundation awarded the man from Anhausen with the Golden Sport Pyramid at a small gala event.
The friendly sportsman is not lacking for awards.
The Federal Cross of Merit, the Silver Laurel Leaf, Champions Tour Player of the Year...
Even the British Queen has bestowed an honour upon him.
Langer is the 18th person to be awarded the Sport Pyramid.
On Saturday, he met the first person to receive it, Hans Günter Winkler, in Aachen.
"This award means a lot to me," said Langer, "because it's not just given for sporting success, but also for social commitment."
Langer has been encouraging up-and-coming talent for years.
And in this vein, he passed the prize money of 25,000 euros on straight away.
The two-time US master's champion was inaugurated into the "Hall of Fame for German Sport" on Saturday, along with 15 other outstanding sportspeople.
Those given the award include track athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, gymnast Eberhard Gienger, fencers Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Putsch and Arnd Schmitt, rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, bob-sleigh rider Meinhard Nehmer, judo player Frank Wieneke, show-jumper Alwin Schockemöhle, and, posthumously, handball player Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sport legends came to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious gathering wandered to the show-jumping stadium, where the Lavazza Prize was underway.
Bernhard Langer kept his distance from the large animals.
Comparing Clinton's and Trump's economic policies: It's all about the money
Both Clinton and Trump want to invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement.
But the two candidates for the US presidency disagree on taxes and energy policies, as well as on one fundamental issue.
There is a fundamental philosophical reason for the differences between Donald Trump's and Hillary Clinton's economic policies.
This is the role of the state.
If in doubt, Trump wants the state's role to be minor, and warns of how the state can damage the economy with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to lead the economy to its death and regulate it to its death, he says.
He would do things totally differently, Trump says.
He would repeal regulations, and lead a wide-reaching tax reform with low rates for private individuals and companies.
Conversely, Clinton says that the state has particular tasks to fulfil, giving disadvantaged people opportunities - and it needs money to do so.
This would increase taxes for the rich, she says.
Interestingly, they have similar views on infrastructure.
There has to be investment in infrastructure, Trump and Clinton say almost verbatim.
The Democratic candidate has even announced the largest investment in jobs since the Second World War.
State programs investing in infrastructure are classic Democrat policies, and are rejected by the tea party wing of the Republican party, which is critical of the state.
Consequently, Trump could lead to discussions within the party.
There are clearer differences to be seen in terms of energy and climate policies.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power stations and bring coal production in the USA back up.
Drilling for oil should be permitted in protected areas, and he wants to withdraw from the Paris Climate Change Treaty.
On the other hand, Clinton wants to use her investment program to extend renewable energies, saying: "One country will become the superpower of renewable energies, and create millions of jobs."
"It will either be China, Germany or America - and I want it to be us."
But it's not just infrastructure that sees the two candidates taking a rather similar stance - they agree in terms of international trade agreements as well.
Neither want to sign TTP, the trans-Pacific trade agreement.
At the same time, neither want to cut the USA off from international trade - they just want to protect American jobs better.
They should then also be better paid, Clinton demands.
The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a pittance, she says.
She wants to raise it to 15 dollars an hour.
It is not quite clear what Trump wants to do on this score: Once he said that the minimum wage had to be raised, then he said it should stay the same.
But the big discussion of the months to come will likely revolve around both parties' tax policies.
Trump is on one side, wanting to relieve the burden on the economy and citizens to boost growth.
His critics state that this will just increase the budgetary deficit.
Clinton is on the opposite side: as a minimum, she wants the rich to pay more taxes, and her critics say that more taxes are not the solution either.
Seeking refuge: "Every refugee woman has dealt with sexual violence"
For women fleeing a country on their own, sexual violence is almost part of daily life.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatised.
One house offers refuge.
Four women are sitting in a large kitchen.
Every one of them has a baby with them, the oldest of which is one year old.
One woman holds her little son in her arms.
He looks around the room inquisitively, his eyes wide.
His mother stares at the tabletop.
Until she realises she's being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the child.
The scene looks normal.
