Iran: Gonu's victims, Palestine's crisis, and a stoning suspended · Global Voices
About two weeks ago, Gonu, a tropical storm, hit Oman and the Sistan and Balouchestan province in Iran.
Iranian bloggers report that victims in this impoverished province have not received enough government help, and that lots of people are deprived of food, water, and health care.
They criticize the government's inaction and media silence.
Victims of storm and silence
Nazi Kavyani writes that thousands of victims are in danger, and that many Iranians have heard no news about the conditions of the victims.
The blogger says:
350,000 people are now threatened with Malaria and Cholera, as well as other diseases and disasters.
Drinking water is at best available for only 30% of the population.
Management of emergency assistance has always been a problem in Iran, judging from the horrific conditions of earthquake victims of recent times.
With the disappearance and obstruction of roads in the area, however, even the slow emergency assistance cannot reach the region to help.
Dissemination of news about the tragedy has also been scant and weak, as the state-owned Iranian radio and television (IRIB) have mostly kept quiet about the extent and depth of the disaster, and the imminence of more complications, is escalating by the minute.
In fact many people inside Iran are not aware of the details and proportions of this unfolding tragedy.
Razeno says a few months ago he/she traveled to the Sistan and Balouchestan province.
The blogger says people living there proudly identify themselves as Iranians athough all they get from Iran is poverty.
The blogger says because of Gonu 30 per cent of the population do not have access to water and are at risk of infection by various diseases.
The blogger adds it is surprising that Iranian government and media mobilized for a flood in Latin America for example, but did not so far move to help Iranians in this poor province.
Futurama asks bloggers and journalists to focus on this news and help informing people about this disaster.
He says the most urgent need of the people is food and water, and then health care.
Natural disaster in Iran is not only issue the only thing Iranian bloggers reacted to.
Several spoke of the Palestine crisis.
"A surprised God and a dying democracy"
Haminjori says even God must be surprised about the recent war in Palestine between Hamas and Fatah.
The blogger says their main goal must be war… Now they cannot go to war against Israel, they must fight with each other instead.
Jomhour says that 100 members of Hamas and Fatah were killed in one week - not by “occupying forces” - but by Palestinians.
The blogger says members of Hamas were dancing around a dead body of a Fatah member, and that Islamic Republic’ TV is silent on it.
Mohmmad Ali Abtahi, former vice president and a cleric, says that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas yesterday dismissed the unity government led by Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, and that the United States backed this decision.
Abtahi calls this act the death of democracy.
He says the United States policy in the Middle East is a real obstacle for democracy in region.
Suspended Stoning
It was not all negative in Iranian blogs this week.
It seems there is at least one news item making many of them happy, for now.
Iranian authorities have temporarily suspended a stoning order.
In Myedan, we read that:
The stoning of Mokarrameh Ebrahimi and the father of her 11-year old illegitimate child was stayed by the written order of the Head of Judiciary in Tehran addressed to the head of the judiciary branch in Takistan.
The stoning had been scheduled for Thursday morning, local time, and the order came less than 24 hours before the scheduled time.
Mokarrameh Ebrahimi is a 43-year old woman who has spent the past 11 years in Choubin prison in Ghazvin after being sentenced to stoning.
The father of the child has also been in prison for 11 years and is scheduled to be stoned with her.
They were accused of having illegal relations with each other.
Zeytoun thinks the reason they suspended the stoning is for fear of people’s protest and that digital media will put the video film of this horror on internet.
Korea: Military Service · Global Voices
Military service in Korea: Is there any topic more sensitive?
And draft dodger?
And even a public figure?
That spells death in society.
Several years ago, a popular male singer chose American citizenship in order to evade military service.
After it was exposed, he is still not allowed to return to Korea.
His main stage is in China now.
His statement in an interview that he hopes to come back to Korea brought outrage among people in Korea.
He isn’t forgiven, especially by men who have already devoted years of their youth to military service.
Maybe he will never be forgiven.
Another singer made a mistake about military service.
While he was in military service, he didn’t perform his duties adequately.
His duty was called ‘byeong yeok teuk rye: san eop che yo won’ (special military service: industrial field service men).
He finished it several years ago.
Then somehow the fact that he did not completely perform all of his duties has been exposed.
After an investigation, it was decided he would go to military service again and he accepted it with public apology.
There are several reasons why he is blamed.
It is suspected that he used a private connection to go to the special military service through his relative, even though he was physically healthy.
Even though he didn’t have any special skills, he was allowed in with a certificate that many Korean young people acquire.
In addition, repeated suspicious military service exemptions for healthy male entertainers (like singers and movie stars) makes people angrier about this scandal.
Does he really have to go through military service again?
Some wonder about it.
That’s the only way to justify military duty.
Others are so sure of this judgment.
Moveon21 was shocked about the decision that the Prosecutors’ Office made.
Oman: Blogging Back on Track · Global Voices
The Omani blogging scene is growing out of Gonu, the tropical storm that hit the country earlier this month.
Bloggers this week have tried to move on and discuss different topics.
Ti3gib thinks that Omani bloggers are fading away and are not as active as bloggers from neighbouring countries:
The number of active bloggers has been decreasing steadily and radically over the last year, and if it continues at this rate, we -Omani bloggers- should be keyboard-silent in a few months from now.
I don't know what the causes are, but I think time-management could be a big role. Too busy, is and excuse but not a reason, maybe laziness and routine and those could easily be dealt with.
As summer approaches, Al Mawaali asks bloggers about their summer plans, and Omani Expat posts about available indoor leisure activities that could be done:
From May to September, temperature and humidity become very high in the Sultanate.
Outdoor activities, such as tourism or trekking, are not possible anymore.
You have to make do with indoor activities, such as :
Intercontinental club, where you can use the swimming pool, squash courts and gym room. .....
This one is the for Omani consumer, Suburban tells her story of horrible customer service, harassment, and the pain of dealing with the delivery boys of a huge electronics shop in Oman:
I bought a shockingly expensive new washing machine last week from EMAX.
It has all the bells and whistles, about ten thousand different washing programmes and comes from a trusted manufacturer.
The salesman was clueless, but as helpful.
A delivery was arranged for two days later.
Two days later, as promised I get a call from the lost delivery guys trying to find my house in the war-zone that is my neighborhood.
Everything went wrong from there.
Bloggers all around Oman have been sharing the Gonu song by Omani singer Salah Al Zadjali, here is what Muscat & Wife said about it:
I know we weren't in the best of spirits because of what happened (Gonu and whatnot), but if you are reading this, then Im sure you have survived it :) I wanted to share something special with you.
Its Salah's Al Zadjali's new song.
One which he wrote during the aftermath of Gonu..
Sudan: UN-AU Troops in Darfur, Ridiculously Expensive Nursery School, Wildlife Returning in South Sudan and Reactions Towards Sudanese Gay Blogger · Global Voices
It has been awhile since the previous round-up of the Sudanese blogosphere but I am now back with another one covering a variety of topics including angry reactions towards a new blog by a Sudanese gay.
Wholeheartedly-Sudaniya posted the following cartoon on the UN's slow response to Darfur and China's involvement:
The Sudanse Thinker shared his thoughts on the recent news of Sudan's acceptance of UN-AU troops in Darfur:
As for Sudan’s acceptance of UN-AU troops in Darfur, do not forget that it is conditional.
There are demands that the force be fully comprised of soldiers from African countries and that it be under AU control.
Those 2 things still need to be worked out.
I wasn’t so excited when I first heard the news since I thought it was the old usual “let’s waste more time” tactic.
I view things differently now.
I’m actually quite ecstatic over the development but I’m just being a little cautious and I’d advise you to be too.
Amjad, a Sudanese blogger living in Oman tells us about Khartoum International Community School (KICS) and the ridiculously high price it charges for nursery school fees:
Imagine, the fees for nursery is about 17,840 New Sudanese Pound. $1 USD = 2.1 NSP, so let's divide that amount into 2.1.
