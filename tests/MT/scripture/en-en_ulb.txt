In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
The earth was without form and empty. Darkness was upon the surface of the deep. The Spirit of God was moving above the surface of the waters.
God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.
God saw the light, that it was good. He divided the light from the darkness.
God called the light "day," and the darkness he called "night." This was evening and morning, the first day.
God said, "Let there be an expanse between the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters."
God made the expanse and divided the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse. It was so.
God called the expanse "sky." This was evening and morning, the second day.
God said, "Let the waters under the sky be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear." It was so.
God called the dry land "earth," and the gathered waters he called "seas." He saw that it was good.
God said, "Let the earth sprout vegetation: plants yielding seed and fruit trees bearing fruit whose seed is in the fruit, each according to its own kind." It was so.
The earth produced vegetation, plants producing seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit whose seed was in it, after their kind. God saw that it was good.
This was evening and morning, the third day.
God said, "Let there be lights in the sky to divide the day from the night and let them be as signs, for seasons, for days and years.
Let them be lights in the sky to give light upon the earth." It was so.
God made the two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He made the stars also.
God set them in the sky to give light upon the earth,
to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. God saw that it was good.
This was evening and morning, the fourth day.
God said, "Let the waters be filled with great numbers of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the expanse of the sky."
God created the great sea creatures, as well as every living creature after its kind, creatures that move and which fill the waters everywhere, and every winged bird after its kind. God saw that it was good.
God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas. Let birds multiply on the earth."
This was evening and morning, the fifth day.
God said, "Let the earth produce living creatures, each according to its own kind, livestock, creeping things, and beasts of the earth, each according to its own kind." It was so.
God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, the livestock after their kinds, and everything that creeps upon the ground after its kind. He saw that it was good.
God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. Let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the sky, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."
God created man in his own image. In his own image he created him. Male and female he created them.
God blessed them and said to them, "Be fruitful, and multiply. Fill the earth, and subdue it. Have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the sky, and over every living thing that moves upon the earth."
God said, "See, I have given you every plant yielding seed which is upon the surface of all the earth, and every tree with fruit which has seed in it. They will be food to you.
To every beast of the earth, to every bird of the heavens, and to everything that creeps upon the earth, and to every creature that has the breath of life I have given every green plant for food." It was so.
God saw everything that he had made. Behold, it was very good. This was evening and morning, the sixth day.































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































These are the words that Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain of the Jordan River valley over against Suph, between Paran, Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab.
It is eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh Barnea.
It happened in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke to the people of Israel, telling them all that Yahweh commanded him concerning them.
This was after Yahweh had attacked Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth at Edrei.
Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses began to announce these instructions, saying,
"Yahweh our God spoke to us at Horeb, saying, 'You have lived long enough in this hill country.
Turn and take your journey, and go to the hill country of the Amorites and to all the places near there in the plain of the Jordan River valley, in the hill country, in the lowland, in the Negev, and by the seashore—the land of the Canaanites, and in Lebanon as far as the great river, the Euphrates.
Look, I have set the land before you; go in and possess the land that Yahweh swore to your fathers—to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob—to give to them and to their descendants after them.'
I spoke to you at that time, saying, 'I am not able to carry you myself alone.
Yahweh your God has multiplied you, and, look, you are today as the multitude of the stars of heaven.
May Yahweh, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times as many as you are, and bless you, as he has promised you!
But how can I myself alone carry your loads, your burdens, and your disputes?
Take wise men, understanding men, and men of good repute from each tribe, and I will make them heads over you.'
You answered me and said, 'The thing that you have spoken is good for us to do.'
So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and men of good repute, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, captains of hundreds, captains of fifties, captains of tens, and officers, tribe by tribe.
I commanded your judges at that time, saying, 'Hear the disputes between your brothers, and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the foreigner who is with him.
You will not show partiality to anyone in a dispute; you will hear the small and the great alike. You will not be afraid of the face of man, for the judgment is God's. The dispute that is too hard for you, you will bring to me, and I will hear it.'
I commanded you at that time all the things that you should do.
We journeyed away from Horeb and went through all that great and terrible wilderness that you saw, on our way to the hill country of the Amorites, as Yahweh our God had commanded us; and we came to Kadesh Barnea.
I said to you, 'You have come to the hill country of the Amorites, which Yahweh our God is giving to us.
Look, Yahweh your God has set the land before you; go up, take possession, as Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has spoken to you; do not be afraid, neither be discouraged.'
Every one of you came to me and said, 'Let us send men ahead of us, so that they may search out the land for us, and bring us word about the way by which we should attack, and about the cities to which we will come.'
The advice pleased me well; I took twelve men of you, one man for every tribe.
They turned and went up into the hill country, came to the Valley of Eshkol, and scouted it.
They took some of the produce of the land in their hands and brought it down to us. They also brought us word and said, 'It is a good land that Yahweh our God is giving to us.'
Yet you refused to attack, but rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh your God.
You complained in your tents and said, "It is because Yahweh hated us that he has brought us out of the land of Egypt, to give us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us.
Where can we go now? Our brothers have made our heart to melt, saying, 'Those people are bigger and taller than we are; their cities are large and are fortified up to the heavens; moreover, we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.'"
Then I said to you, 'Do not be terrified, neither be afraid of them.
Yahweh your God, who goes before you, he will fight for you, like everything that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes,
and also in the wilderness, where you have seen how Yahweh your God carried you, as a man carries his son, everywhere you went until you came to this place.'
Yet in spite of this word you did not believe Yahweh your God,
who went before you on the way to find a place for you to make camp, in fire by night and in a cloud by day.
Yahweh heard the sound of your words and was angry; he swore and said,
'Surely not one of these men of this evil generation will see the good land that I swore to give to your ancestors,
save Caleb son of Jephunneh; he will see it. To him I will give the land that he has stepped on, and to his children, because he has wholly followed Yahweh.'
Also Yahweh was angry with me because of you, saying, 'You also will not go in there;
Joshua son of Nun, who stands before you, he will go in there; encourage him, for he will lead Israel to inherit it.
Moreover, your little children, the ones you said would be victims, who today have no knowledge of good or evil—they will go in there. To them I will give it, and they will possess it.
But as for you, turn and take your journey into the wilderness along the way to the Sea of Reeds.'
Then you answered and said to me, 'We have sinned against Yahweh; we will go up and fight, and we will follow all that Yahweh our God has commanded us to do.' Every man among you put on his weapons of war, and you were ready to attack the hill country.
Yahweh said to me, 'Say to them, "Do not attack and do not fight, for I will not be with you, and you will be defeated by your enemies.'
I spoke to you in this way, but you did not listen. You rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh; you were arrogant and attacked the hill country.
But the Amorites, who lived in that hill country, came out against you and chased you like bees, and struck you down in Seir, as far as Hormah.
You returned and wept before Yahweh; but Yahweh did not listen to your voice, nor did he pay attention to you.
So you stayed in Kadesh many days, all the days that you stayed there.

Blessed is the man who does not walk in the advice of the wicked, or stand in the pathway with sinners, or sit in the assembly of mockers.
But his delight is in the law of Yahweh, and on his law he meditates day and night.
He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water that produces its fruit in its season, whose leaves do not wither; whatever he does will prosper.
The wicked are not so, but are instead like the chaff that the wind drives away.
So the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.
For Yahweh approves of the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.

























































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































The proverbs of Solomon son of David, the king of Israel.
These proverbs are to teach wisdom and instruction, to teach words of insight,
that you may receive instruction in order to live by doing what is right, just, and fair.
These proverbs are also to give wisdom to the naive, and to give knowledge and discretion to young people.
Let wise people listen and increase their learning, and let discerning people get guidance,
to understand proverbs, sayings, and words of wise people and their riddles.
The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of knowledge— fools despise wisdom and instruction.
My son, hear the instruction of your father and do not lay aside the rules of your mother;
they will be a graceful wreath for your head and pendants hanging from your neck.
My son, if sinners try to entice you into their sin, refuse to follow them.
If they say, "Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood, let us hide and attack innocent people for no reason.
Let us swallow them up alive, like Sheol takes away those who are healthy, and make them like those who fall into the pit.
We shall find all kinds of valuable things; we will fill our houses with what we steal from others.
Throw in your lot with us; we will all have one purse together."
My son, do not walk down that road with them; do not let your foot touch where they walk;
their feet run to evil and they hurry to shed blood.
For it is useless to spread the net in the sight of any bird.
These men lie in wait for their own blood— they set an ambush for their own lives.
So are the ways of everyone who gains riches by injustice; unjust gain takes away the lives of those who hold on to it.
Wisdom cries aloud in the street, she raises her voice in the open places;
at the head of the noisy streets she cries out, at the entrance of the city gates she speaks,
"How long, you naive people, will you love being naive? How long, you mockers, will you delight in mockery, and how long, you fools, will you hate knowledge?
Pay attention to my correction; I will pour out my thoughts to you; I will make my words known to you.
I have called, and you have refused to listen; I reached out with my hand, but there was no one who paid attention.
But you have ignored all my instruction and paid no attention to my correction.
I will laugh at your calamity, I will mock you when the terror comes—
when your fearful dread comes like a storm and disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you.
Then they will call upon me, and I will not answer; they will desperately call for me, but they will not find me.
Because they hate knowledge and did not choose the fear of Yahweh,
they would not follow my instruction, and they despised all my correction.
They will eat the fruit of their ways, and with the fruit of their schemes they will be filled.
For the naive are killed when they turn away, and the indifference of fools will destroy them.
But whoever listens to me will live in safety and will rest secure with no fear of disaster."
















































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































The Song of Songs, which is Solomon's.
Oh, that he would kiss me with the kisses of his mouth, for your love is better than wine.
Your anointing oils have a delightful fragrance; your name is like flowing perfume, so the young women love you.
Take me with you, and we will run. The king has brought me into his rooms. We are glad; We rejoice about you; let us celebrate your love; it is better than wine. It is natural for the other women to adore you.
I am dark but lovely, you daughters of Jerusalem— dark like the tents of Kedar, lovely like the curtains of Solomon.
Do not stare at me because I am dark, because the sun has scorched me. My mother's sons were angry with me; they made me keeper of the vineyards, but my own vineyard I have not kept.
Tell me, you whom my soul loves, where do you feed your flock? Where do you rest your flock at noontime? Why should I be like someone who wanders beside the flocks of your companions?
If you do not know, most beautiful among women, follow the tracks of my flock, and pasture your young goats near the shepherds' tents.
I compare you, my love, to a mare among Pharaoh's chariot horses.
Your cheeks are beautiful with ornaments, your neck with strings of jewels.
We will make for you gold ornaments with silver studs.
While the king lay on his couch, my nard emitted its fragrance.
My beloved is to me like a bag of myrrh that spends the night lying between my breasts.
My beloved is to me like a cluster of henna flowers in the vineyards of En Gedi.
Listen, you are beautiful, my love; listen, you are beautiful; your eyes are doves.
Listen, you are handsome, my beloved, how handsome. The lush plants are our bed.
The beams of our house are cedars; our rafters are firs.

The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham.
Abraham was the father of Isaac, and Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers.
Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez the father of Hezron, and Hezron the father of Ram.
Ram was the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon the father of Salmon.
Salmon was the father of Boaz by Rahab, Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth, Obed the father of Jesse.
Jesse was the father of David the king, David the father of Solomon by the wife of Uriah.
Solomon was the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, Abijah the father of Asa.
Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, and Joram an ancestor of Uzziah.
Uzziah was the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, Ahaz the father of Hezekiah.
Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, and Amon the father of Josiah.
Josiah was an ancestor of Jechoniah and his brothers at the time of the deportation to Babylon.
After the deportation to Babylon, Jechoniah was the father of Shealtiel, Shealtiel was an ancestor of Zerubbabel.
Zerubbabel was the father of Abiud, Abiud the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim the father of Azor.
Azor was the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Achim, and Achim the father of Eliud.
Eliud was the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, and Matthan the father of Jacob.
Jacob was the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, by whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ.
All the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, from David to the deportation to Babylon fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon to the Christ fourteen generations.
The birth of Jesus Christ happened in the following way. His mother, Mary, was engaged to marry Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant by the Holy Spirit.
Her husband, Joseph, was a righteous man, and he did not want to disgrace her publicly. So he decided to secretly end his engagement with her.
As he thought about these things, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, because the one who is conceived in her is conceived by the Holy Spirit.
She will give birth to a son, and you will call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins."
All this happened to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,
"Behold, the virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call his name Immanuel"—which means, "God with us."
Joseph woke up from his sleep and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and he took her as his wife.
But he did not have sexual relations with her until she gave birth to a son. Then he called his name Jesus.



























































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
This one was in the beginning with God.
All things were made through him, and without him there was not one thing made that has been made.
In him was life, and the life was the light of men.
The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.
There was a man who was sent from God, whose name was John.
He came as a witness to testify about the light, that all might believe through him.
John was not the light, but came that he might testify about the light.
The true light, which gives light to all men, was coming into the world.
He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world did not know him.
He came to his own, and his own did not receive him.
But to as many as received him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God.
These were not born of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
The Word became flesh and lived among us. We have seen his glory, glory as of the one and only who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.
John testified about him and cried out, saying, "This was the one of whom I said, 'He who comes after me is greater than I am, for he was before me.'"
For from his fullness we have all received grace after grace.
For the law was given through Moses. Grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
No one has seen God at any time. The one and only God, who is at the side of the Father, he has made him known.
This is the testimony of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites to him from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are you?"
He confessed—he did not deny, but confessed—"I am not the Christ."
So they asked him, "What are you then? Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not." They said, "Are you the prophet?" He answered, "No."
Then they said to him, "Who are you, so that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?"
He said, "I am a voice, crying in the wilderness: 'Make the way of the Lord straight,' just as Isaiah the prophet said."
Now some from the Pharisees were sent,
and they asked him and said to him, "Why do you baptize then if you are not the Christ nor Elijah nor the prophet?"
John answered them, saying, "I baptize with water. But among you stands someone you do not know.
He is the one who comes after me, the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie."
These things were done in Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
The next day John saw Jesus coming to him and said, "Look, there is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!
This is the one of whom I said, 'The one who comes after me is more than me, for he was before me.'
I did not know him, but it was so that he could be revealed to Israel that I came baptizing with water."
John testified, saying, "I saw the Spirit descending like a dove from heaven, and it stayed upon him.
I did not recognize him, but he who sent me to baptize in water said to me, 'Upon whom you shall see the Spirit descending and remaining on him, he is the one baptizing in the Holy Spirit.'
I have both seen and testified that this is the Son of God."
Again, the next day, as John was standing with two of his disciples,
they saw Jesus walking by, and John said, "Look, the Lamb of God!"
His two disciples heard him say this and they followed Jesus.
Then Jesus turned and saw them following him and said to them, "What do you want?" They replied, "Rabbi (which translated means teacher), where are you staying?"
He said to them, "Come and see." Then they came and saw where he was staying; they stayed with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.
One of the two who heard John speak and then followed Jesus was Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter.
He first found his own brother Simon and said to him, "We have found the Messiah" (which translated is: Christ).
He brought him to Jesus, and Jesus looked at him and said, "You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas" (which is translated Peter).
The next day, when Jesus wanted to leave to go to Galilee, he found Philip and said to him, "Follow me."
Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
Philip found Nathaniel and said to him, "He of whom Moses wrote in the law, and the prophets, we have found him: Jesus son of Joseph, from Nazareth."
Nathaniel said to him, "Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?" Philip said to him, "Come and see."
Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him and said about him, "See, a true Israelite, in whom is no deceit!"
Nathaniel said to him, "How do you know me?" Jesus answered and said to him, "Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you."
Nathaniel replied, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!"
Jesus replied and said to him, "Because I said to you, 'I saw you underneath the fig tree,' do you believe? You will see greater things than this."
Then he said, "Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see the heavens opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man."




























































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































The former book I wrote, Theophilus, told all that Jesus began to do and to teach,
until the day that he was taken up, after he had given commands through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen.
After his suffering, he presented himself alive to them with many convincing proofs. For forty days he appeared to them, and he spoke about the kingdom of God.
When he was meeting together with them, he commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, about which, he said, "You heard from me
that John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit in a few days."
When they were assembled together they asked him, "Lord, is this the time you will restore the kingdom to Israel?"
He said to them, "It is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father has determined by his own authority.
But you will receive power, when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you will be my witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."
When the Lord Jesus had said these things, as they were looking up, he was raised up, and a cloud hid him from their eyes.
While they were looking intensely to heaven as he went, suddenly, two men stood by them in white clothing.
They said, "You men of Galilee, why do you stand here looking into heaven? This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven, will return in the same manner as you saw him going into heaven."
Then they returned to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives, which is near to Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey.
When they arrived, they went up into the upper chamber, where they were staying. They were Peter, John, James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James.
They were all united as one, as they diligently continued in prayer. Included were the women, Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.
In those days Peter stood up in the midst of the brothers, about 120 people, and said,
"Brothers, it was necessary that the scripture should be fulfilled, that the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who guided the ones who arrested Jesus.
For he was one of us and received his share of the benefits of this ministry."
(Now this man bought a field with the earnings he received for his wickedness, and there he fell headfirst, and his body burst open, and all his intestines poured out.
All those living in Jerusalem heard about this, so they called that field in their language "Akeldama," that is, "Field of Blood.")
"For it is written in the Book of Psalms, 'Let his field be made desolate, and do not let even one person live there'; 'Let someone else take his position of leadership.'
It is necessary, therefore, that one of the men who accompanied us all the time the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,
beginning from the baptism of John to the day that he was taken up from us, must be a witness with us of his resurrection."
They put forward two men, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was also named Justus, and Matthias.
They prayed and said, "You, Lord, know the hearts of all people, so reveal which of these two is the one whom you have chosen
to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned away to go to his own place."
They cast lots for them, and the lot fell to Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.




















































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God,
which he promised beforehand by his prophets in the holy scriptures,
concerning his Son who was a descendant of David according to the flesh.
Through the Spirit of holiness he was declared with power to be the Son of God by the resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord.
Through him we have received grace and apostleship for obedience of faith among all the nations, for the sake of his name.
Among these nations, you also have been called to belong to Jesus Christ.
This letter is to all who are in Rome, the beloved of God, who are called to be holy people. May grace be to you, and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world.
For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of his Son, of how continually I make mention of you.
I always request in my prayers that by any means I may at last be successful now by the will of God in coming to you.
For I desire to see you, that I may give you some spiritual gift, in order to strengthen you.
That is, I long to be mutually encouraged among you, through each other's faith, yours and mine.
Now I do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, that I often intended to come to you, (but I was hindered until now), in order to have a harvest among you, just as I have had among the rest of the Gentiles.
I am a debtor both to Greeks and to foreigners, both to the wise and to the foolish.
So, as for me, I am ready to proclaim the gospel also to you who are in Rome.
For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation for everyone who believes, for the Jew first and for the Greek.
For in it God's righteousness is revealed from faith to faith, as it has been written, "The righteous will live by faith."
For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of people, who through unrighteousness hold back the truth.
This is because that which is known about God is visible to them. For God has enlightened them.
For his invisible qualities, namely his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse.
This is because, although they knew about God, they did not glorify him as God, nor did they give him thanks. Instead, they became foolish in their thoughts, and their senseless hearts were darkened.
They claimed to be wise, but they became foolish.
They exchanged the glory of the imperishable God for the likenesses of an image of perishable man, of birds, of four-footed beasts, and of creeping things.
Therefore God gave them over to the lusts of their hearts for uncleanness, for their bodies to be dishonored among themselves.
It is they who exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and who worshiped and served the creation instead of the Creator, who is praised forever. Amen.
Because of this, God gave them over to dishonorable passions, for their women exchanged natural relations for those that were unnatural.
Likewise, the men also left their natural relations with women and burned in their lust for one another. These were men who committed shameless acts with men and received in themselves the penalty they deserved for their error.
Because they did not approve of having God in their awareness, he gave them up to a depraved mind, for them to do those things that are not proper.
They have been filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, and malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, and evil intentions. They are gossips,
slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventing ways of doing evil; they are disobedient to parents.
They are senseless, faithless, heartless, and unmerciful.
They understand the regulations of God, that those who practice such things are deserving of death. But not only do they do these things, they also approve of others who do them.
















































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































Long ago God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in many ways.
But in these last days, he has spoken to us through a Son, whom he appointed to be the heir of all things. It is through him that God also made the universe.
He is the brightness of God's glory, the exact representation of his being. He even holds everything together by the word of his power. After he had made cleansing for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.
He has become just as superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than their name.
For to which of the angels did God ever say, "You are my son, today I have become your father"? Or to which of the angels did God ever say, "I will be a father to him, and he will be a son to me"?
But again, when God brings the firstborn into the world, he says, "All God's angels must worship him."
About the angels he says, "He is the one who makes his angels spirits, and his servants flames of fire."
But to the Son he says, "Your throne, God, is forever and ever. The scepter of your kingdom is the scepter of justice.
You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness. Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of joy more than your companions."
"In the beginning, Lord, you laid the earth's foundation. The heavens are the work of your hands.
They will perish, but you will continue. They will all wear out like a piece of clothing.
You will roll them up like a cloak, and they will be changed like a piece of clothing. But you are the same, and your years do not end."
But to which of the angels has God said at any time, "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a stool for your feet"?
Are not all angels spirits who serve, and who are sent to care for those who will inherit salvation?

































































































































































































































































































James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes in the dispersion: Greetings!
Consider it all joy, my brothers, when you experience various troubles.
You know that the testing of your faith produces endurance.
Let endurance complete its work, so that you may become fully developed and complete, not lacking anything.
But if any of you needs wisdom, let him ask for it from God, the one who gives generously and without rebuke to all who ask, and he will give it to him.
But let him ask in faith, doubting nothing. For anyone who doubts is like a wave in the sea that is driven by the wind and tossed around.
For that person must not think that he will receive anything from the Lord.
Such a person is double-minded, unstable in all his ways.
Let the poor brother boast of his high position,
but the rich man of his low position, because he will pass away as a wild flower in the grass.
For the sun rises with burning heat and dries up the grass. The flower falls off, and its beauty perishes. In the same way, the rich man will fade away in the middle of his journey.
Blessed is the man who endures testing. For after he has passed the test, he will receive the crown of life, which has been promised to those who love God.
Let no one say when he is tempted, "I am tempted by God," because God is not tempted by evil, nor does he himself tempt anyone.
But each person is tempted by his own desire, which drags him away and entices him.
Then after the desire conceives, it gives birth to sin, and after the sin is full grown, it gives birth to death.
Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers.
Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above. It comes down from the Father of lights. With him there is no changing or shadow because of turning.
God chose to give us birth by the word of truth, so that we would be a kind of firstfruits of all the things that he created.
You know this, my beloved brothers: Let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger.
For the anger of man does not work the righteousness of God.
Therefore take off all sinful filth and abundant amounts of evil. In humility receive the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.
Be doers of the word and not only hearers, deceiving yourselves.
For if anyone is a hearer of the word but not a doer, he is like a man who examines his natural face in a mirror.
He examines himself and then goes away and immediately forgets what he was like.
But the person who looks carefully into the perfect law of freedom, and continues to do so, not just being a hearer who forgets, this man will be blessed in his actions.
If anyone thinks himself to be religious, but if he does not control his tongue, he deceives his heart, and his religion is worthless.
Religion that is pure and unspoiled before our God and Father is to help the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained by the world.

















































































Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the foreigners of the dispersion, the chosen ones, throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia.
This is according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, set apart by the Spirit for obedience and for the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ. May grace be to you, and may your peace increase.
May the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ be praised! In his great mercy, he has given us new birth to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.
This is for an inheritance that will not perish, will not become stained, and will not fade away. It is reserved in heaven for you.
You are protected by God's power through faith, for the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last times.
You are very glad about this, even though it is now necessary for you to feel sadness in many different troubles.
This is for the proving of your faith, which is more precious than gold that perishes, even though it is tested by fire. This happens so that your faith will be found to result in praise, glory, and honor at the revealing of Jesus Christ.
You have not seen him, but you love him. You do not see him now, but you believe in him and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory.
You are now receiving for yourselves the result of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
The prophets searched and inquired carefully about this salvation, about the grace that would be yours.
They searched to know about whom and when the Spirit of Christ in them was speaking to them. This was happening as he was telling them in advance about the sufferings of Christ and the glorious things after that.
It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves, but you, when they spoke of the things that have now been told to you by those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven—things into which angels long to look.
So gird up the loins of your mind. Be sober. Put your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you when Jesus Christ is revealed.
As obedient children, do not conform yourselves to the desires that you followed when you were ignorant.
But as the one who called you is holy, you, too, be holy in your whole behavior.
For it is written, "Be holy, because I am holy."
So if you call "Father" the one who judges impartially and according to each person's work, go through the time of your journey in reverence.
You know that it was not with perishable silver or gold that you have been redeemed from the foolish behavior that you learned from your fathers.
Instead, you have been redeemed with the precious blood of Christ, who was like a lamb without blemish or spot.
Christ was chosen before the foundation of the world, but now he has been revealed to you in these last times.
Through him you believe in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope would be in God.
You made your souls pure by obedience to the truth. This was for the purpose of sincere brotherly love; so love one another earnestly from the heart.
You have been born again, not from perishable seed, but from imperishable seed, through the living and remaining word of God.
For, "All flesh is like grass, and all its glory is like the wild flower of the grass. The grass dries up, and the flower falls off,
but the word of the Lord remains forever." This is the good news that was announced to you.











































































































































































































































































































This is the revelation of Jesus Christ that God gave him to show his servants what must soon take place. He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John.
John testified about the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ, all the things that he saw.
Blessed is the one who reads aloud this prophecy, and those who listen to the words of this prophecy and who obey what is written in it, because the time is near.
John, to the seven churches in Asia: May grace be to you and peace from the one who is, and who was, and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before his throne,
and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To the one who loves us and has released us from our sins by his blood—
he has made us a kingdom, priests for his God and Father—to him be the glory and the power forever and ever. Amen.
Look, he is coming with the clouds; every eye will see him, including those who pierced him. All the tribes of the earth will mourn because of him. Yes, Amen.
"I am the alpha and the omega," says the Lord God, "the one who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty."
I, John—your brother and the one who shares with you in the suffering and kingdom and patient endurance that are in Jesus—was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony about Jesus.
I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day. I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet.
It said, "Write what you see in a book, and send it to the seven churches—to Ephesus, to Smyrna, to Pergamum, to Thyatira, to Sardis, to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea."
I turned around to see whose voice was speaking to me, and as I turned I saw seven golden lampstands.
In the middle of the lampstands there was one like a son of man, wearing a long robe that reached down to his feet and a golden sash around his chest.
His head and hair were as white as wool—as white as snow—and his eyes were like a flame of fire.
His feet were like polished bronze, like bronze that had been refined in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of many rushing waters.
He had seven stars in his right hand, and a sword with two sharp edges was coming out of his mouth. His face was shining like the sun at its strongest.
When I saw him, I fell at his feet like a dead man. He placed his right hand on me and said, "Do not be afraid. I am the first and the last,
and the one who lives. I was dead, but look, I live forever! And I have the keys of death and of Hades.
Therefore write down what you have seen, what is now, and what will take place after this.
As for the hidden meaning about the seven stars you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lampstands: The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches."
